# Flask-Form-Handling-and-Data-Storage
This project is a simple Flask-based web application that allows users to submit a form with details such as Name, Email, Phone, Age, Gender, and Address. The submitted data is stored in an SQLite/MySQL database and displayed on a separate page in a structured table.
